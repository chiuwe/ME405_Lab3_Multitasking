\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-This file contains the code for a task class which will be instantiated many times to test how many tasks can be safely run on various \-A\-V\-R processors using the \-M\-E507/\-Free\-R\-T\-O\-S software.

\-Revisions\-: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 09-\/30-\/2012 \-J\-R\-R \-Original file was a one-\/file demonstration with two tasks \item 10-\/05-\/2012 \-J\-R\-R \-Split into multiple files, one for each task \item 10-\/25-\/2012 \-J\-R\-R \-Changed to a more fully \-C++ version with class task\-\_\-sender \item 10-\/27-\/2012 \-J\-R\-R \-Altered from data sending task into \-L\-E\-D blinking class \item 11-\/04-\/2012 \-J\-R\-R \-Altered again into the multi-\/task monstrosity\end{DoxyItemize}
