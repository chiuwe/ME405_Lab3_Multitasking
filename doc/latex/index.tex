\-This program implements a set of tests to verify that the \-M\-E405 library's inter-\/task communication works. \-It's also a usable example of how the queues and shared data items are used. \-In addition, it helps to show why non thread safe data transfer is a bad idea; there is a global variable used to pass data between two tasks, and as the program runs, the global variable sometimes gets corrupted.

\-The task diagram for this program is shown below. \begin{center}

 \-There are a couple of unusual features on this task diagram. \-The number of \char`\"{}multi-\/tasks\char`\"{} can be varied by changing {\ttfamily \-N\-\_\-\-M\-U\-L\-T\-I\-\_\-\-T\-A\-S\-K\-S} in {\ttfamily \hyperlink{test__main_8cpp_a840291bc02cba5474a4cb46a9b9566fe}{main()}}. \-These multi-\/tasks are a bunch of tasks, all created from the same class, that are used to put some stress on the \-R\-T\-O\-S by running lots of tasks at the same time. \-The multi-\/task's timing includes a delay of random duration; this timing scheme causes tasks to pre-\/empt each other with random timing. \-The data sink task normally runs very quickly, looking for changed data; if it finds data, it delays by 20 ms to give other tasks some time to run. \-The data sink therefore takes up a lot of \-C\-P\-U time, and one can see that the user interface runs slowly because of this.

\-When this program is running, one can press the \char`\"{}v\char`\"{} key in a terminal window to cause the program to display a task status report. \-A typical report is shown below. 
\begin{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyCode}
 \-This report shows tasks and their current priorities and states. \-Also, for the data sink task, it shows a report of how accurately the data from the data source task has been received. \-One should see that there have been no errors in sending data through the queue or shared data item, but the use of a global variable has caused errors due to task switching while the data was being written or read.
